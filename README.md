**Instructions:**
- Copy low resolution images from the test set in `input_images` (provided as empty directory)
- Run `python main.py`
- Upscale images will come out in `output_images` (automatically created and cleaned if already exists)
- By default BOE-R3 model is used. The GPU number and model parameters can be changed in main.py.
